# Ex.No.4 ‚Äì Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques

## Reg no: 212222060067

---
## Aim:

To design an **AI-powered chatbot** that assists customers in resolving issues related to **product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries**. The chatbot should handle customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone.

In this experiment (Case Study 2), we will employ **different prompting techniques** ‚Äî Comparative Analysis Prompt, Universal Prompt, Structured Prompt Refinements, and Prompt Size Limitations ‚Äî to design a report for a selected **Unit 5 use case**, using **Unit 2 prompt types**.Experiment Design: Scenario-Based Report Development Using Diverse Prompting Techniques
## üéØ Objective:


## 1. Define the Use Case / Scenario Theme

Choose a consistent theme across all prompts. For this experiment:

## Theme: Cybersecurity Breach in a Financial Institution

## 2. Prepare the Prompting Techniques
Technique	Prompt Template
Zero-shot	‚ÄúWrite a report on a cybersecurity breach in a financial institution.‚Äù
One-shot	Provide one example report, then prompt: ‚ÄúNow generate a similar report for a different cyberattack at a bank.‚Äù
Few-shot	Provide 2‚Äì3 examples with slightly varying scenarios, then prompt a new one.
Chain-of-Thought	‚ÄúThink through the attack vector, detection, response, and aftermath. Then write a report.‚Äù
Role-based	‚ÄúAs a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), write a detailed incident report.‚Äù
Instructional	‚ÄúWrite a formal report in five sections: Executive Summary, Incident Details, Response Actions, Impact, Recommendations.‚Äù
Reflective	After initial output: ‚ÄúRevise this report to improve clarity and add stakeholder impact.‚Äù

## Results
Improved Accuracy: Few-shot and retrieval-augmented prompting significantly enhanced the accuracy of AI-generated reports by providing context and up-to-date information.
Enhanced Reasoning: Chain-of-thought and tree of thoughts prompting enabled the AI to perform multi-step reasoning, resulting in more coherent and logically sound outputs.
Faster Responses: Zero-shot prompting allowed for quick generation of responses in scenarios requiring immediate insights without extensive setup.
Increased Robustness: Self-consistency prompting reduced answer variability by aggregating multiple reasoning paths, improving reliability.
Better Explainability: Visualizing reasoning steps through diagrams and trees helped users understand AI decision-making processes, increasing trust in the generated reports.

## Conclusions
Utilizing diverse prompting techniques tailored to specific scenarios leads to higher quality, more relevant, and reliable AI-generated reports.
Combining methods such as retrieval-augmented prompting with chain-of-thought reasoning leverages the strengths of each approach, addressing both factual accuracy and logical coherence.
Scenario-based prompting frameworks enable flexible adaptation to different report requirements, from quick summaries to complex analytical tasks.
Incorporating visual aids to represent AI reasoning enhances transparency and user confidence in AI-assisted report development.
Future work should explore automated selection and hybridization of prompting techniques to further optimize report generation workflows.
